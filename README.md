## Description
This is our AI Course project implements multiple search and optimization algorithms to analyze crime datasets . We will implement these algorithims to solve the problems related to crimes and police patroling. The project is written in Python and we have implemented the algorithims we have studied in the course such as heuristic search (GBFS), constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), Min Max and Alpha Beta Pruning.

## Features
Crime data preprocessing and cleaning

Implementation of multiple AI algorithms

Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) for police deployment

Search algorithms like BFS, DFS, A Star ,Min Max, Alpha Beta Pruning

Scrutny algorithims like Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning to find the best police routes and filter out he dangerous criminals.

Performance evaluation of different approaches
