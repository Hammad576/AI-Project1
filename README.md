## AI Project 1
## Description
This AI-based project implements multiple search and optimization algorithms to analyze crime datasets and solve various AI problems. The project is written in Python and focuses on different AI techniques such as heuristic search, constraint satisfaction, and game-playing strategies.

## Features
Crime data preprocessing and cleaning

Implementation of multiple AI algorithms

Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) for police deployment

Search algorithms like BFS, DFS, A*

Game-playing algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

Performance evaluation of different approaches
